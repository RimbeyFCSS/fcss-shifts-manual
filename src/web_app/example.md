# Example Usage Scenario

## Shift is offered
Bob is normally supposed to work HS1 on the 25th of August, however he can't because he has an important appointment at the nearby bar.

Bob thus needs to offer his shift so someone else can replace him. He first visits [shifts.rimbeyfcss.com](https://shifts.rimbeyfcss.com/), signs in, clicks the "Submit Shift" at the top, fills in and submits the form, and then waits for administration to process it.

## Offered shift is processed
Becky works as administration and sees the request appear in the "Unprocessed Requests" view in the "Requests" table. She checks the current schedule on [shifts.rimbeyfcss.com](https://shifts.rimbeyfcss.com/), see that bob is indeed the current possessor of that shift, and accepts the request.

## Shift is taken
Around 5-15 minutes later, The site is updated and emails are sent out to HCAs letting them know that the shift is being offered. Burt sees the shift being offered and decides he could use some more hours. He clicks on the shift in the "Offered Shifts" section, fills in and submits the form, and then waits for his request to be processed. Barry also does the same, albeit a few minutes later.

## Taken shift is processed
Becky now sees that Burt and Barry both want to take the shift. She checks the website to make sure that shift is being offered, and accepts Burt's request but *rejects Barry's request since Burt submitted his **first***.

Had Becky accepted both, this would have resulted in an *error*, which would then appear on the website.
