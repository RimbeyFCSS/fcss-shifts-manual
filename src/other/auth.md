# Authentication

Authentication is handled through [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), which is a service by Google which offers accounts and sign in authentication. 

Everything related to accounts and passwords is done through Google Firebase, and has no other connection to the website or database.

Other than knowing how it works, there is no need for you to access or work with this component. Recovering lost passwords etc. can be entirely done by individual account holders.
