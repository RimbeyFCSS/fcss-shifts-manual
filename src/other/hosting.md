# Hosting

Hosting is done through [Vercel](https://vercel.com/dashboard), which is the service that receives orders from the Automation component to rebuld the site. 

This portion actually runs the program to build the site and then display it.

Other than knowing how it works, there is no need for you to access or work with this component.
