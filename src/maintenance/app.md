# Deprecation within the site generator

If the advice in the previous sections have not helped you, then the issue may be beyond your control.

In short, you have checked that:

- The database does *not* contain empty rows / views, or empty cells, and all of the requests are in proper order
- The automation system is still running fine (the last rebuild was very recent)
- The site is either *not loading at all*, or *not updating*. Again, if it is simply showing incorrect data then the problem is almost certainly within the database and can be easily fixed.

If this is the case, then the problem is likely due to the hosting or code withint he repository, which are beyond your control. See the next section for how to get help for this issue.
