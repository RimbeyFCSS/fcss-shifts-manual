# Introduction

This is a manual for the [RFCSS Shifts site](https://shifts.rimbeyfcss.com/). Inside you will find a guide on how to get started, as well as a description of the components and what to do if something breaks.

It is important to note that if a user is having problems with the website, it is almost a *guarantee* that it can be fixed by reading the instructions in this manual, so make sure to do that before you seek help elsewhere!

The guide to getting a HCA set up on the website can be found [here](https://rimbeyfcss.github.io/presentations/rfcss-shifts.html#/).
