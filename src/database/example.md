# Example Usage Scenario

A previous example showing how shifts might be processed is in the [Web App Component section](/web_app).

- If a new staff member is added and wishes to access the site, add their name and email to the "AllowList" table.
- If a HCA's regular shift is being changed, change it in the "Schedule" table.
