# Navigating

## Tables
You can switch to different tables by clicking the tabs at the top. For example, click on "Requests" to enter the Requests table.


## Views
You can then change to a different view depending on which data you wish to see. Views can be selected from the left-most menu just below the tabs at the top.

Each view is a different "view" of the same data, using certain filters, groupings, sortings, etc. which can be seen to the right of the name of the view.

For example, the "Rejected" view is a "table" (denoted by the blue grid next to the name), with data grouped and sorted by the Date. There is also a filter applied, which only allows data that has the "Status" = "Rejected" to be seen.

## Cells, Records, and Fields
Data is organized in "records" (rows) and "fields" (columns). A cell corresponds to a specific field for a specific record.

To modify a cell, click on it to select it, then click again. Depending on what it is (a selection, text, date, etc.) you may get a different popup, or no popup at all. 

To modify things like text or numbers, double-click on the cell instead.

To delete an entire row, right-click and then select "Delete record".

To modify things like the options in a selection field (such as staff names), click the arrow to the right of the field's name, and click "Customize field type".
