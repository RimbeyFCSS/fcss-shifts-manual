# Processing Requests

To process unprocessed requests, navigate to the "Requests" table, and switch to the "Unprocessed" view. You can then see all requests which have no yet been given a status.

To process them, change their status to either "Rejected" or "Accepted" by clicking on the cell for that row. Once you do so, the row should disappear (since it is no longer unprocessed), and it will appear in the "Processed" view.

If you ever wish to view a certain category of requests, please use the corresponding views, or make your own! For example, if you wish to see *all* requests, change the view to *all*. To see more information on views, see the resources linked in the [first page of the Database Component section](/database).

Filtering and sorting happens automatically, so as soon as you change the information in a request (such as accepting it), it may cause the request to disappear from the view.
