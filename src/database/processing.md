# Processing Requests

To process unprocessed requests, navigate to the "Requests" table, and switch to the "Unprocessed" view. You can then see all requests which have no yet been given a status.

To process them, change their status to either "Rejected" or "Accepted" by clicking on the cell for that row. Once you do so, the row should disappear (since it is no longer unprocessed), and it will appear in the "Processed" view.

If you ever wish to view a certain category of requests, please use the corresponding views, or make your own!
