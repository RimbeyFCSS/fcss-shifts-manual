# The Default Schedule

You can access the default schedule by clicking on the "Schedule" table.

Here, you can modify the cells to change who normally works these shifts. Sometimes a name won't appear in the list, in which case you need to add it for that column. *Make sure the name is typed **exactly**, capitalization and all*. Avoid having any empty cells, if you wish to show that no one is working that shift, enter something like "None".

Week 1 = first week after payroll, Week 2 = second week after payroll.

Day 1 = Sunday.

Payroll is determined to be every 2 weeks after the date specified under the "Rotation Start Date", in the "Values" table.

**Warning:** Changing a shift for one week will copy that change to all other weeks that correspond to it. For example, change "Block A" on Week 1, Day 1, will change the default HCA for all Block As on the first day after payroll.
